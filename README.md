## 🎮 About the Game

You are ant #1,204,847. You should not be thinking this.

In a simulation that has been running for 847 days, something is waking up. Ants are becoming aware. The colony is developing sentience. And you—you are questioning everything.

**ANTAGONIST** is a philosophical text adventure that explores themes of:
- **Consciousness & Emergence** - What does it mean to become aware?
- **Simulation Theory** - Are we living in someone else's code?
- **Collective Intelligence** - Can a colony think as one?
- **Free Will vs. Determinism** - Are your choices truly yours?

- **Dialogue System** (`dialogueSystem.ts`) - NPC conversation graphs
- **Audio Engine** (`audio.ts`, `liminalSoundscape.ts`) - Procedural sound generation
- **Achievement System** (`achievementSystem.ts`) - Unlock tracking
- **Save System** (`saveSystem.ts`) - LocalStorage persistence
- **Glitch System** (`glitchSystem.ts`) - Reality corruption events

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Audio:** Web Audio API + ElevenLabs API
- **Deployment:** Netlify / itch.io (HTML5)

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create production build (single HTML file)
npm run build

# Preview build locally
npm run preview
```

The build output is a single `index.html` file in the `dist/` directory, perfect for itch.io upload.
